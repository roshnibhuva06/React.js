🚀 Counter 2.0
A simple yet enhanced counter application built with React.js, showcasing conditional rendering, button control, and logic-based output like Even/Odd and Prime Number detection.

🔼 Increment Button
data-testid="plusonebtn"

Increases the count by 1 on every click.

🔽 Decrement Button
data-testid="minusonebtn"

Decreases the count by 1, but is disabled when count is 0 (to prevent negative values).

🔁 Reset Button
data-testid="resetbtn"

Resets the counter back to 0.

🔢 Odd or Even Indicator
data-testid="odd-or-even"

Dynamically displays whether the current count is:

Even — if divisible by 2

Odd — if not divisible by 2

✅ Case-sensitive output: Only display "Even" or "Odd" exactly as specified.

🧮 Prime Number Checker
data-testid="is-prime"

Determines if the current count is a prime number or not.

Displays "true" for prime numbers.

Displays "false" for non-prime numbers, including 0 and 1.

✅ Case-sensitive output: Only "true" or "false".

Introduces the power of React state management using useState().

Teaches conditional rendering with live UI updates.

Helps beginners understand mathematical logic like:

Odd or Even numbers

Prime number identification
